<blockquote>
  <p>If voting could change anything it would be made illegal!</p>

  <p>— Anonymous</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Manufacturing consent</em> has been the modern means by which the <em>few powerful</em> gets to control the <em>many powerless</em>.
Since <em>the many</em> won’t give up their power so easily, the powerful must find new ways in convincing <em>the many</em>
that the candidate of their choice does not enjoy as much support</p>

<p>In this article, I will convince you with publicly available data that
Democratic party insiders are trying manufacture consent in the current 2020 Democratic primary
season. Specially, they are trying to prop up the candidates of their choice — Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren &amp; Pete Buttigieg — while
undermining the candidates like Bernie Sander’s candidacy thru this “poll” route</p>

<p>Many of the pollsters publish their polling methodology, sampled demographics, which they then publish along with the results.
Sure, we might disagree with the methodology (or) the demographic selection, but we atleast have these details before commenting on
whether the poll is legitimate or not</p>

<p>We now have a new phenomenon where a pollster that neither publishes their methodology, nor demographics,
but publishes the outcome of which candidates gets what percentage of votes which media picks-up to run
non-stop propaganda</p>

<p>This is the story of one such establishment pollster who publishes polls that are highly questionable at best, outright corrupt at worst</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>If you paid attention to news lately, you would notice media telling everyone that <em>Bernie is losing steam</em> while <em>Warren is surging</em></p>

<p>To this end, I would like to focus on one of the recent polling published by an organization called <strong>Focus on Rural America</strong>. I’ll refer to this organization as <em>FORA</em> from now on</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/PpollingNumbers/status/1174315218593341440" target="\_blank"><img src="images/twitter-political-polls-highlight.png" alt="Diagram: Political Polls: Summary of Focus on Rural America" class="featured-image img-fluid margin-auto" /></a></p>

<p>Here are some of the media outlets that picked the poll put out by <em>FORA</em></p>

<ol>

</ol>

<p>There are lot more outlets that picked up this. To see all of them go <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=&quot;focus+on+rural+america&quot;&amp;tbm=nws" target="\_blank">here</a></p>

<p>And some political commentators have already picked this stuff &amp; spreading it among their followers</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/davidaxelrod/status/1174299432692719616" target="\_blank"><img src="images/david-axelrod.png" alt="Diagram: David Axelrod sharing FORA poll" class="featured-image img-fluid margin-auto" /></a></p>

<p>I am told by others that mainstream TV outlets like MSNBC ran multiple segments based on this specific poll. I will update this post when I gets access to the footage</p>

<p>Since many legitimate media outlets &amp; TV talking heads are taking this poll seriously to push an agenda, lets take a close look at the organization</p>

<h2 id="uncovering-the-actors">Uncovering the actors</h2>

<p>Lets start with analyzing the credibility of this poll publisher <em>FORA</em>; specifically,</p>

<ol>
  <li>Who are behind it</li>
  <li>Which pollster do they use</li>
  <li>What polling methodology does the pollster use</li>
</ol>

<p>If you go to the link, You would notice that the poll is published by someone named <em>Jeff Link</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.focusonruralamerica.com/190914-iowa-voter-survey-memo/" target="\_blank"><img src="images/iowa-voter-survey-summary-page-highlight.png" alt="Diagram: Focus on America Summary page" class="featured-image img-fluid margin-auto" /></a></p>

<p>When you click on the Author’s link, you get <em>The page you requested could not be found.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.focusonruralamerica.com/author/jeff/" target="\_blank"><img src="images/jeff-not-found-highlight.png" alt="Diagram: Jeff does not exists" class="featured-image img-fluid margin-auto" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.focusonruralamerica.com/about/">About</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.focusonruralamerica.com/contact-us/">Contact</a> page does not help us either</p>

<p>A different page on the website explains that <em>Jeff Link</em> is the co-founder of <em>FORA</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.focusonruralamerica.com/2019/09/18/september-2019-poll-results/" target="\_blank"><img src="images/jeff-mention-in-fora-highlight.png" alt="Diagram: Jeff Link is the co-founder of FORA" class="featured-image img-fluid margin-auto" /></a></p>

<p>Navigating the website does not give you anymore information about who this man is.
If you google for his name, you will notice interesting things about him.
He also has expertise in <em>paid media strategy</em> &amp; <em>public opinion-research</em> while being a democratic operative.
He was ex-Bill Clinton staffer &amp; also ran <em>Paid Media and Research to the Obama for America Campaign</em> — specifically — <em>he coordinated all paid media and polling in 25 states</em>.
He also ran political campaigns in <em>Ukraine</em> &amp; <em>Hungary</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.linkstrategies.com/our-team/jeff-link/" target="\_blank"><img src="images/jeff-link-strategies-highlight.png" alt="Diagram: Jeff Link - Link strategies" class="featured-image img-fluid margin-auto" /></a></p>

<p>The same post also mentions another person who holds the post of chair in <em>FORA</em>, namely <strong>Patty Judge</strong> who also happens to be <em>Past Lt. Governor and Secretary of Agriculture</em> for Iowa</p>

<p><a href="http://www.focusonruralamerica.com/2019/09/18/september-2019-poll-results/" target="\_blank"><img src="images/patty-in-fora-highlight.png" alt="Diagram: Patty Judge is the Chair of FORA" class="featured-image img-fluid margin-auto" /></a></p>

<p><em>Patty Judge</em> gave glowing views of <em>Elizabeth Warren</em> in Jan 2019 a month after warren announced her candidacy to enter Democratic primary</p>

<p><a href="https://www.macleans.ca/politics/washington/elizabeth-warren-haunted-by-ghosts-of-sexism-past/" target="\_blank"><img src="images/patty-praising-warren-highlight.png" alt="Diagram: Patty Judge praising Warren" class="featured-image img-fluid margin-auto" /></a></p>

<p>Not just that, as recently as Jun 2019, she hung around warren during her visit an ethanol factory in Iowa</p>

<p><a href="http://www.focusonruralamerica.com/2019/06/13/warren-judge-tour-ethanol-plant/" target="\_blank"><img src="images/warren-and-patty-on-field-trip-highlight.png" alt="Diagram: Patty Judge accompanying Warren" class="featured-image img-fluid margin-auto" /></a></p>

<p>Going over the past posts further gives a glimpse of who else are behind <em>FORA</em></p>

<p>A post dating back to May 2017 lists a man named <strong>Sam Roecker</strong> as an Advisor.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.focusonruralamerica.com/2017/05/30/new-nonprofit-seeks-boost-progressive-causes-rural-america/" target="\_blank"><img src="images/sam-roecker-in-fora-highlight.png" alt="Diagram: Sam Roecker in FORA" class="featured-image img-fluid margin-auto" /></a></p>

<p>His twitter profile says he worked as the state director for <strong>John Hickenlooper</strong>
the same man who was after Bernie in the recent presidential polls before <a href="(https://www.newsweek.com/john-hickenlooper-withdraw-2020-presidential-race-1454440),">dropping out</a></p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/SamRoecker" target="\_blank"><img src="images/sam-roecker-twitter-highlight.png" alt="Diagram: Sam Roecker in Twitter" class="featured-image img-fluid margin-auto" /></a></p>

<p>When you look at the people behind the organization, what you get are a set of actors who</p>

<ol>
  <li>Worked for the Democratic establishment in the past; Clinton, Obama &amp; more</li>
  <li>Worked for recent primary opponent (Hickenlooper) of Bernie</li>
  <li>Who praise Warren (another opponent of Bernie) &amp; hang around with her during primary campaign</li>
</ol>

<p>Even with all the establishment actors running the show, its possible that the poll might still be a <strong>credible</strong> one — if the pollster conducted the poll is a scientific manner</p>

<p>So, lets look at the methodology of the organization that conducted this so called “poll”</p>

<h2 id="uncovering-the-pollster">Uncovering the pollster</h2>

<p>On the last page of the <a href="http://www.focusonruralamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/190914-Iowa-Voter-Survey-memo.pdf">report</a>,
it is mentioned that a pollster named <strong>David Binder Research</strong> has conducted these polls.
We will get back to the pollster lil later</p>

<p><a href="http://www.focusonruralamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/190914-Iowa-Voter-Survey-memo.pdf" target="\_blank"><img src="images/fora-methodology-highlight.png" alt="Diagram: Sam Roecker in Twitter" class="featured-image img-fluid margin-auto" /></a></p>

<p>When you look at the report, you dont get any idea about what questions were actually posed to the voters &amp; what their answers were.
You are told vague things like</p>

<ol>
  <li>Percent with Positive Opinion</li>
  <li>Ruled Out <em>vs</em> Actively Considering</li>
</ol>

<p>They dont tell us how these voters are selected, what their demographics are, white/black/asian/native american,
men/women, rich/middle class/working poor, old/middle aged/young. Nothing. You get no details about these important factors</p>

<p>They simply have a four page document which has tables that says this is what we found.
Most bad polls atleast give made-up numbers, made up criteria, but this one does not even bother with that foreplay.
It just jumps into the conclusions on what percentage of votes each of democratic primary candidate will get</p>

<p>Now lets get back to finding who is behind <em>David Binder Research</em></p>

<p>As per <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/lists/hispanic_pollsters/david_binder.html">Real clear politics</a>, <em>David Binder Research</em> is run by a guy
named <em>David Binder</em>, who worked as an <em>in-house pollster for the Obama campaign in 2008 and 2012</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/lists/hispanic_pollsters/david_binder.html" target="\_blank"><img src="images/david-binder-on-rcp-highlight.png" alt="Diagram: David Binder in RCP" class="featured-image img-fluid margin-auto" /></a></p>

<p>The most important aspect being</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Binder specializes in <strong>qualitative</strong> rather than <strong>quantitative</strong> research.
His focus is on assessing <strong>subjective factors</strong> such as <strong>language</strong>, <strong>emotion</strong>, and <strong>attitudes</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>All of this word salad means only one thing.
It means he mind-reads potential voters when conducting his so called “polling”.
In simple terms his polls compasses <em>his fellings</em> about <em>voter’s feelings</em> about politicians</p>

<p>I have never heard a worse way to describe a pollster than this.
Given that there are no serious data points in the published poll,
what we are presented are the <strong>feelings</strong> of <em>David Binder</em> staff
about which democratic candidate gets what percentage of votes in Iowa
in the upcoming democratic primary election</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>An organization called <em>Focus on Rural America</em> run by ex-dem staffers/leaders,
who ran paid campaigns for Bill Clinton &amp; Obama, who worked as State directors for Bernie’s primary opponents,
who has apparent allegiance to current Democratic primary runners like Elizabeth Warren
publish so called “poll”s where Bernie is even below <em>Pete Buttigieg</em> —
conducted by an ex-Obama staffer which is apparently based on someone’s <em>feelings</em> —
publish polls that have no substance &amp; are complete outlier polls —
which are then pickedup by mainstream media for pushing free propaganda for Warren &amp; other corporate dems — 
morning till night everyday till this propaganda becomes reality in the minds of undecided voters</p>

<p>What else do you call this other than <em>Manufacturing Consent</em> by democratic establishment
in connivance with their toadies in the mainstream media to push a corporate democratic candidate?</p>

In this article I will explain in depth as to how existing democratic structures function the way they function, why they dont work for people & how to fix them.

TLDR: In order to break the _vicious cycle_, we must create structural incentives that fund all 3 phases of *the trinity* that forms the _virtuous cycle_, namely _Incubation_, _Distribution_ & _Implementation_.
_Incubation_ is about creation of ideas that help society, this include _Think tanks_, e.t.c.
_Distribution_ is about spreading of these ideas in the public sphere so that the rest of the society is aware of them, this include _News Media_, _Pressure groups_, e.t.c.
Finally, _Implementation_ is about implementing the ideas that were both _incubated_ & _distributed_. This include _On the ground mobilisation_, _Political parties_, politics in general.
All the three phases must be funded in a structural fashion in the form of **Democracy tokens**.
A **Democracy token** is just like cash, which is automatically granted to every citizen of the country. No questions asked.
A **Democracy token** cannot be encashed by citizens, but can only be donated to one of the the groups that are essential for the survival of democracy.
This **Democracy token** can be encashed by the respective organisation which received these tokens from the exchequer for real cash to run its operations.
For the 3 phases of _the trinity_, we will have 4 types of **Democracy token**s, each covering four major areas.
One set of _democracy tokens_ is called _Incubation tokens_ for _Incubation_, lets call them .
2nd set of _democracy tokens_ is called _Media Tokens_ which can be donated to _Media_, includes any & all types of media thats involved in news & current affiars. The channel/org must be dedicated news & current affairs. Entertainment outlets are strictly prohibited from receiving any tokens.
3rd set of _democracy tokens_ is called _Civil society Tokens_ which can be donated to _Pressure Groups_, includes any & all types of social organisations/activist groups that are essential for democracy. Except being barred illegal, any & every group can claim these token.
The final & 4th set of tokens is called _Political tokens_ which can be donated to anyone who runs for a _Political office_ (or) to a _Political party_
This _democracy tokens_ must be funded in a systemic manner by tax payer, not thru generosity/goodwill of any one individual person/group.

## Problem statement

A Democracy where elections happen once in 4/5 years where we are only allowed to pick a person once

1. We have to earn money to put food on the table. On top of that we also have to fight the people who make a lot of money on our misery & use that money to fight us while we roll under the wheel of

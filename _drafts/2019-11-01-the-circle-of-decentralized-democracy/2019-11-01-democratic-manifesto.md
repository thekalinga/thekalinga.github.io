In this article, I will take an indepth look at how existing structures function in a Democracy,
why existing political system we call Democracy as it is practiced today is completely illegitimate,
how it is by design rigged against citizens while wearing the cloak of political legitimacy &
most importantly a future vision on how a future Democracy should look if it were to truly work for citizens

## Introduction

Suppose, you own multiple large estates that spans multiple locations.
Since managing a mutliple estates is a lot of work for you, you wanted to hire an estate manager to take care of all estates.

You spoke to a friend who explained the process of hiring a good estate manager.
You are told he would connect you with few experts who inturn can help finding the best manager to manage your estate.

As promised, he hooked you up with multiple experts who have brought you multiple manager profiles for you to review.
All the candidates brought to you for interview by these experts are vouched have excellent track record by your friend.
So, based on your friends & expert's recommendation, you picked one of candidates as your estate manager

Few weeks passed by & you started notice something odd.
You started getting inflated bills for maintenance of estate from a third party for the same kind of service you used to get at much lower rate.
Plus, you started realising all valubles in the house are being sold at dirt cheap rate to the same third party from whom you got earlier inflated bills.
Later, you realised random people are taking dumps within your estate, when confronted says he is not answerable to you but only to the manager, all the while wearing a uniform that has exact same logo as the third party.

Once you realised this, you wanted to fire & sue the estate manager.
You confronted him. But to your surprise, you are not allowed to meet him. He now has a Personnel assistant & his PA says the manager is too busy to see you as he is busy managing the estate.
You press your demand to meet the manager & explain to PA what happened. 
The PA instead tells you that you cant fire your manager for the next 4/5 years no matter what happens with the estate because thats the contract you signed with the manager.

After such devastating experience, you did little more digging on your estate manager & that mysterious third party.
To your surpise, you got to know that your manager is & has been getting paid by the third party thats robing you blind.
Not just that, all the experts that recommended the manager profiles were all funded by this third party to recommend these names.
And the kicker, the person whom you thought was your friend that recommendeded these "experts" himself is paid by this third party.

Would you feel that you were betrayed?
Thats what we call Democracy.

Surprised?

Lemme do a simple replacement of words

* `Family` => `Voters (You & Me)`
* `Estate (family owned)` => `Democracy (collectively owned)`
* `Friend` => `Media`
* `Expert` => `Thinktank`
* `Estate manager` => `Politician`
* `Third party` => `Moneyed interests`
* `Taking dump` => `Environmental destruction`

Makes sense? No?

If you dint follow, dont worry, I will explain in the [next section](#existing-system) all the way from basics as to the foundational structures that underlie what we today call democracy & how it has been reduced to a sham by systematic capture at every level by special interests

If all we are allowed to do is, give control to 1 out of 2 (or) more pre-selected choices obediently every n (=3/4/5/6) years once in a special place called — polling booth, its not a Democracy.
Its a scam masqurading as Democracy

By the end of this article, I share a future vision of Democarcy where the real power is captured by people permanently & will explain why almost all of the following well meaning fixes to existing Democratic structures are doomed to fail

* We need to elect only honest people. If majority dont fall for dumb people & vote in honest people everytime, these honest people will run the system honestly 
* If we get free healthcare, free education, afforable housing we are good to go
* If elections are publicly financed, our political system will be fixed
* Most of the public dont want to pay for news & want it for free. If only majority are not greedy & fund media, we will be able to stop capture of institutes
* And more such well meaning by half baked to completely naive ideas

In this article, I will attempt to explain the structural foundations of current scam we call Democracy &
why none of the above solutions are sustainable &
offer how the future must look if we were to actually live in a Democracy thats in the hands of people who give that structure its legitimacy

I hope to keep these hard promises by the end of the article.
Lets move ahead by understanding the stuctural foundations of our existing (sham) democractic political system

## Foundation

Let start by defining a term `successful idea`.
A `successful idea` is an idea that's implemented.
A success/failure of an idea has no bearing on whether such an idea is moral/immoral.
But as long as the idea is implemented, I call it a `successful idea` because its an idea thats successful in perpetuating itself within the society it operates in

Every `idea` thats ever successful always goes thru the following three major phases, lets call them — _the trinity_

1. Incubate
2. Disseminate/Distribute
3. Execute/Implement

![current-power-structure-phases-of-successful-idea](current-power-structure-phases-of-successful-idea.svg)

Let me explain each of these phases with a concrete example

Suppose your community has certain resources & the community needs to identify how to best allocate such resources to the betterment of community, by consent of majority.
Here are some reasonable commonsense steps we can follow before we can make an educated choice amongst list of possible allocations (ideas) & implement the one majority think is most appropriate

* Identify all possible ways in which resources can be allocated, i.e `incubate` ideas about resource allocation
* Such an `incubation` is not good enough unless these ideas are meaningfully `dissimenated`/`distributed` to everyone in the community so that they can make an educated decision about which ideas are in thier best interests
* `Dissemination` of ideas is not good enough, unless they are `executed`/`implemented`

So, every `successful idea` aka an idea thats already excecuted/will be executed always goes thru _the trinity_, _Incubation_, _Dissemination/Distribution_ & finally _Execution/Implemention_ phases

These 3 steps forms the foundation of every modern society as a society is nothing but a set of ideas that are in various phase of above 3 three stages. Any unsuccessful idea by definition will not reach the Excecution stage & will be dropped before much earlier in lifecycle 

If any one/more steps of the _the trinity_ are be compromised by vested interests, we have a fully compromsed system.
It is my hypothesis that every steps of _the trinity_ is fully compromised in the existing rot we call Democracy & we need to fix this rot

In order to justify my hypothesis, lets take a look at existing political system also known as (aka) _Vicious cycle_, by keeping in the three major phases

## Existing system aka _Vicious cycle_

In our existing political structure we call Democracy, we are allowed to vote once every x years (assuming that voter supression does not exist & we are not a sibling of "democracies" like _Democratic Republic Of North Korea_).
In essence, we are allowed to pick one amongst a set of candidates every now & then.

In theory, we have a "choice" to pick whoever we like.
But in practice, do we have a really choice?

(or)

The choices we are presented with are artifically rigged, over which we have little to no control what so ever?

\*

To understand that, lets 1st take a look at how vested interests have captured all phases of _the trinity_ which every successful idea must travels thru

Lets start from the most common entities that almost every citizen is familier with

* Media
* Politician/Political party

The role _Media_ is supposed to play is about educating masses with nuances that we might not have the time/experterise to analyse, as we are busy with daily chores in order to make a living.
Media's role involves distribution of ideas, both new (policies that have not yet become `successful`) & challenging existing ideas (policies that are curently being enforced, i.e already `successful` ideas).
The primary role media plays is in the `dissemination`/`distribution` of idea phase so that every citizen is equipped with the knowledge to make an educated choice in the polling booth in future during election & also understand how the society he lives in functions

The _politician_/_political party_ plays mutliple major roles

a. Dissemination/Distribution/Advocacy of ideas
b. Implementation/Execution of ideas (assuming they won election)

NOTE: Political parties sometimes act as idea incubation centres aswell, but this is not as significant as modern policy incubation require large data analysis, which is quite outside the realm of politicians. So, this tiny aspect is intentionally ignored to simply this analysis

Essentially the major role _Media_ plays is in the `dissemination` phase of the ideas, by educating the citizens thru discussion, debates around `ideas`;
while the politician/political party plays major roles in `dissemination` & `execution` of ideas

The important aspect missing from the above actors is, who creates (`incubates`) the policy (`idea`) that Media and Politicians dissminates & Politician finally executes?

Creating (`incubate`) a policy proposal (`idea`) generally requires analysis of society at a fundamental level, such as gathering metrics about industrial production, employment statistics, social status of various demographics, e.t.c.
Since data collection & analysis of large datasets about society is not in the competence of either media/politicians,
this role is fulfilled by an actor thats not wellknown to general public but are known to both Media & Politicial class.
This actor is known in the industry as a _Thinktank_.
The purpose of this actor is to do the backroom work of collection & analysis all data required to create (`incubate`) policy (`idea`s) proposals.

Along with the above actors, we also have special interests groups (also known as pressure groups) whose main purpose is to influence the lifecycle of a policy (`idea`) in various stages.
These include religious groups, social groups, labour unions, lobby groups for private interests, e.t.c. 
Some of these groups skip the distribution step of convincing society i.e skip `distribution` step completely & reach final `impelmentation` stage thru corrupt means by giving the right incentives to politicians directly (kickbacks, political funding, blackmail, e.t.c)

All of these groups eventually particpate in 1 (or) more steps of _the trinity_

To simplify this analysis, I'm only considering the broad strokes in this article.
When we connect these 3 major actors we have seen earlier with the phases in our trinity, this is how they map

* Thinktank/Researchers => Idea incubator
* Media/Special interest groups => Idea distribution
* Politician/Political party => Idea execution

### How all phases are connected

Lets understand each of these 3 phases in existing system with a concrete `idea` (policy). In this example, lets put ourselves in the shoes of most previlged people on the planet.

Lets assume we are rich people (who does least amount of work in the society, but enjoys highest comfort) & want our taxes to be reduced (even tho we are not paying our fair share currently), so that we can avoid paying the running costs of society from which we made unjustifiably disproportionate profits out of other people's labour.

How do we go about it?

#### 1. Idea incubation

Every functioning society has expenses to pay for, i.e building new roads, hospitals, bridges, schools, public housing, e.t.c pay for salaries of employees (police, civil administration, e.t.c), pensions, social safety net & a lot more.

Since tax cuts yielding more revenue is counter-intuitive (as credible as snakeoil treating anyone's cancer) & is a hard sell, we need to bring credibility to this (awful) idea.
We need to use the power of statistics to bring credibility to an idea that will be dismissed as a scam by any rational person.
This is where idea `incubation` centers (thinktanks) come in.
The job of these thinktanks is to publish reports (unadultrated BS) thru selective analysis of data, using which we can claim credibility for the obvious scam idea of _Things will trickle down to you if you do youself a favor of giving me more money thru tax cuts_

Since we want our _taxes_ to be reduced, which means, Govt will have shortfall. So, it needs to do 1 of 2 things

Either cut down on the existing expenses, cut down Govt staff, remove social safety net, e.t.c

(or)

The cuts must yield more revenues indirectly so Govt can continue with status quo

The chances of us getting our policy propsal (`idea`) becoming `successful` goes up significantly if we can address both of these areas.

Here how its currently done.

Here is how the `ideas` gets `incubated` will look like (simplified into simple words) Fund the following thinktanks, each of which need to gather & analyse data on

1. Public services
2. Investment, Industrial production, Consumption & Employment

Thinktank (1) needs to produce a report on Public services
Each of the above thinktank must reach the following pre-dtermine goals selective data analysis

Public services needs to be cut because — poor people are moochers, huge burden on the society & they are sucking the blood out of hard working tax payers. So Govt should save this money & spend it on more useful things like giving incentives to the industry (i.e more money for me)


The reason why the employment is not going up is because Govt is not giving enough incentives to rich people (meaning, rich people are not "investing" & are willing to forego profits because Govt dint give them enough money, I know its absurd, but that's the logic we operate under), if more money is given to us, we will produce so many more jobs that the Govt will get even more taxes thru these new jobs.
More taxcuts => More industries => More employment => More taxes.
So, revenue loss for Govt. due to taxcuts to top 1% will be compenstaed indirectly thru these new taxes


The important point being, it does not matter what lies must be propagated, so long as the data can be twisted & the "reports" produced that have some statistics backing it.
The point of this whole exercise is building acedemic credibility

Since we live an alleged Democracy, no voter would buy such a proposal as its outright unfair, the same policy must be implemented but thru a veneer of legitmacy.
The legitimacy will be acquired thru selective collection & fradulent interopretation of data.
So, this is how the scam works in today's Democracy

These rich folks will fund multiple _researchers_/_thinktanks_/_idea incubators_, whose job is to selectively collect & comb thru the existing data (employment/otherwise) and reach the pre-determined conclusion—Lets give more money to rich guys & cut social benefits for every citizen.
The proposal does not say exactly that, but it goes something like this.
After analyzing all the employment data, the reason why we are not having enough jobs is because the _job creators_ (hint: rich folks, which is a blatent lie and I will address this lie in an another article) are not given sufficient tax incentives.
If Govt can remove the _tax terror_ & give _tax incentives_, these _job creators_ would create open lot more factories, employ far more people, everything would be great for the society at large.

With this spin, the same fradulent _idea_ is presented with the veneer of legitimacy because now the argument has cherry picked historical macro econmic data backing it.

Now that we have a fully incubated _idea_ aka policy proposal & its fully compromised by vested interests because these vested interests have far more spare money than most citizens.

The agrument which says "why dont citizens fund thier own thinktanks/research incubation centers" is a fundamentally flawed argument because we have a asymmetic distribution of welath to spare beyond our sustinance.
Rich folks already took advantage of the existing system to become rich. Since they are rich, they have a lot of money to spare beside thier normal sustinence. So, them spending millions out of the spare money they accumulated on thinktanks/researchers is an investment which will potentially yield them more riches.
On the flipside, most citizens stuggle to pay for housing, food, healthcare, tution fee for kids, pay for basic susutinance & have very little to spare when all expenses are paid for.
This complete asymetry of power is at the root of everything wrong in the current society.

Now lets move on to next phase of our trinity

#### 2. Idea distribution

The likelyhood of getting an incubated idea moving to a successful idea is far higher if such an idea can get legtimacy thru public approval.
This is where Media & Pressure groups come in

Media & pressure groups play the primary role in disseminating these ideas

The same rich folks that funded earlier "research" from the think tank will also fund the media channel thru various means

1. Outright purchase of media outlets if they have deep pockets
2. Buy advertising whose main purpose is to keep media to play ball with them

Once either of them is achived, the media will start talking about a "new reasearch" has looked into reasons why unemployment is on the rise & how to tackle that.
They will run multiple shows inviting "researchers"/"experts" to explain the viewers what these they found out during thier "research".
Unsurprisingly, the "expert" thats are invited for the discussion on these TV shows will be the same researchers that funded by the rich folks

Not just that, media will also invite the politicians that are funded by the same rich folks that want to push the policies which give more money to these rich folks at the expense of the rest of the society

So, the distribution phase of the

can only be done by collecting the role of idea incubation is largely delegated to a

1. We have to earn money to put food on the table. On top of that we also have to fight the people who make a lot of money on our misery & use that money to fight us while we roll under the wheel of


Why none of are sustainable

* If we elect honest people, they will fix the system
* If we get free healthcare, free education, afforable housing we are on a solid footing
* If publicly finance elections, it will fix the system
* If public fuind media, we will be able to fix the system

## Solution

## In depth look

## FAQ


* What about minority rights
* How will you ensure a corrupt crooks will not dismantle the whole structure once he gets hold of it
* How will you ensure they dont outspend all of us & buy all the tokens?

(I will write a seperate article as to why giving away power for more than 2years to a small group of politicians itself anti-thesis of Democracy in modern world, but lets not worry about that for now)



TLDR: In order to break the _vicious cycle_, we must create structural incentives that fund all 3 phases of *the trinity* that forms the _virtuous cycle_, namely _Incubation_, _Distribution_ & _Implementation_.
_Incubation_ is about creation of ideas that help society, this include _Think tanks_, e.t.c.
_Distribution_ is about spreading of these ideas in the public sphere so that the rest of the society is aware of them, this include _News Media_, _Pressure groups_, e.t.c.
Finally, _Implementation_ is about implementing the ideas that were both _incubated_ & _distributed_. This include _On the ground mobilisation_, _Political parties_, politics in general.
All the three phases must be funded in a structural fashion in the form of **Democracy tokens**.
A **Democracy token** is just like cash, which is automatically granted to every citizen of the country. No questions asked.
A **Democracy token** cannot be encashed by citizens, but can only be donated to one of the the groups that are essential for the survival of democracy.
This **Democracy token** can be encashed by the respective organisation which received these tokens from the exchequer for real cash to run its operations.
For the 3 phases of _the trinity_, we will have 4 types of **Democracy token**s, each covering four major areas.
One set of _democracy tokens_ is called _Incubation tokens_ for _Incubation_, lets call them .
2nd set of _democracy tokens_ is called _Media Tokens_ which can be donated to _Media_, includes any & all types of media thats involved in news & current affiars. The channel/org must be dedicated news & current affairs. Entertainment outlets are strictly prohibited from receiving any tokens.
3rd set of _democracy tokens_ is called _Civil society Tokens_ which can be donated to _Pressure Groups_, includes any & all types of social organisations/activist groups that are essential for democracy. Except being barred illegal, any & every group can claim these token.
The final & 4th set of tokens is called _Political tokens_ which can be donated to anyone who runs for a _Political office_ (or) to a _Political party_
This _democracy tokens_ must be funded in a systemic manner by tax payer, not thru generosity/goodwill of any one individual person/group.


Policy = Idea
Incubation = Identification

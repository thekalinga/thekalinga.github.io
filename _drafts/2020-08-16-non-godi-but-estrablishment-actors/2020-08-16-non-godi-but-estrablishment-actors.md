Recently, there was a serious arson in Bangalore that has resulted in 

his video is what the damage the self proclaimed "activists" can do to others. Remember Amrutha? As soon as she said what she said on the stage, many people instantly did what these people here in this video did. Immediately threw her under the bus tho they knew the reality of the situation.

As expected, everyone include Faye had very little to no skepticism of power & the consequences of the actions of power. They threw everyone under the bus as if it was all pre-meditated & the party to whom the arrested leader belongs to somehow needs to be banned because few in the mob turned vehicles upside down as police refused to do their job of filing FIR. Delaying the FIR in no way gives the mob the right to damage/burn vehicles/damage property. However, why are these self-proclaimed "activists" & "leaders" cant ever describe consequences of violence in an even handed way? BJP, Congress & many political parties in India not only burnt vehicles, but committed pogroms against citizens of this country & continue to do so. I am not sure if these "leaders" asked for the ban of BJP/Congress for their history, even for ban of BJP for recent Delhi pogrom, which I very much doubt. These self proclaimed "activists" & "leaders" know on which side the power lies & what needs to be said when.

And the policeman in this video is simply allowed to make stuff about Bangalore protest by Campus Front, which I assume to be the protest at Rajbhavan. What the police man has engaged in is mis-information campaign. If my memory serves me right, Congress & no other party organised a street protest thruout CAA/NRC protest in Bangalore once police started refusing permissions. Even the one at Townhall where people defied police was not organised by Congress, its done by "Hum Bharat Ke Log" and that too after the protest permission was revoked by Police under clear political orders. Without police permission (aka police holding whip on whether we can exercise our rights or not), everyone more or less folded. When police were not allowing protests on streets against CAA & most of us were shouting in group therapy areas with the Orwellian name of "protest sites", rather than a forceful demand thru on the street protests, Campus Front did protest on the street, right infront of Rajbhavan when police were refusing permission left, right & center with malafide intent. So, police are obviously not happy about that protest as it was a real protest, unlike our regular group therapy sessions in safe spaces (which are broadly safe from public awareness) with no serious consequence. Later, I got to know that Campus Front is affiliated with PFI whose workers were involved in one infamous barbaric act in Kerala of chopping a lecturer's hand for alleged insult to prophet of Islam, which is quite troubling history. But, the protest by Campus Front in Bangalore is quite legitimate & was a valid exercise of our constitutionally guaranteed rights. BTW, I also attended the protest without knowing before I knew who were protesting. Again, against, CAA, everyone who is against fascism needs to stand together even if we dont agree with each other on everything so long as its made clear that we have clear difference of opinion when it comes to violence. I respect Campus Front for what the protest they did at Raj Bhavan when police were refusing to permission from street protest.

However, in this video, the police man was allowed to spout lies & insinuations about PFI while rest aka Activists, Leaders & Establishment journalists are grandstanding as to how righteous they are & how they see more conspiracies than the police themselves. When a mob gathers, things can go out of hands very easily [which I did not know in the past, but now I can see clearly with the benefit of hindsight]. Sure, those who gather people have the responsibility to try & ensure no untoward incident happens, inform crowd of ensuring that agent-provocateurs (if there are any) have very little power & not provoke people to take matters into their own hands.

Its alleged by police that it's a high crime rate area which is refuted by the jouranlist on the panel immediatel. Even if its a high crime area, but does that amount to planning & masterminding everything? And the absurd inference that it was all pre-planned attackâ€”as if asking people to come to police station for filing a complaint over social media (which is what's alleged) amounts to pre-planning? If they wanted to pre-plan, why will they even go to the police station for filing FIR? Also, the police allges that people were asking police to handover the person to them (implying they wanted mob justice), which again is disputed by co-panelist who was at the scene. And to the allegation of conspiracy of having petrol to burn that many vehicle. The fact is getting petrol if not that hard, whether from a petrol station/from an already standing vehicle & it does not need a huge pre-planning. It can be done withour much effort once the mob realises that police are under political control & are refusing to do their job (mostly under the direction of Congress leaders). The most likely inference that can be drawn is because the accused is the nephew of Congress MLA. The conspiracies espoused in this video are quite nonsense. The only question valid to ask is, were the SDPI leaders arrested police actively involved in the arson/aroused people to commit arson? If yes, how higher the communication went? What also must be assertained is the culpability of Police in refusing to do their duty & subsequent killing of people which led to large scale arson.

In India, its a well-known fact that police will not file a complaint in most of the cases. Look at the annual number of FIRs registered in a station. In the area where I live, the total # of FIRs registered by Police are <300 for the whole year. Officially, as per our police station, in the whole area, not even 1 crime is committed per day as per their records. In another police station where police filed a false charge against me for protesting with all sorts of fiction, the whole station which is in an area thats highly crime prone, the total number of FIRs are again <300. It's because, police refuse file FIR unless the permission is granted by ACP/DCP, which is what the policeman in the discussion was also saying, this way they can show that there were no crimes under their jurisdiction. When someone related to any powerful person is involved, Indian police will not file the FIR at all unless things come out in the news, despite FIR (First information report) is just the starting point of reporting an alleged crime. This is a well known knowledge in India, but our "activist" will tell us it takes 5-6hrs for filing FIR. What is the need for police to go & pick the accused up rightaway before even filing FIR? If police did their job of registering an FIR (even if it takes 5-6 hrs), wouldn't people wait outside if police tell them FIR is being composed? Also, why should it take 5-6hrs for reporting as simple as reporting an incident as benign as reporting a tweet/post?

Police will only file FIRs in few non-controversial topics but has social pressure such as women's groups (if the women approaches the station thru the women's groups & the accused has support of no powerful person), e.t.c. And many of these activists have close relationship with police as they see that collaborating with police atleast gets the FIR to be registered (plus allows them to gain credentials aswell as a sideeffect). So, they are to be seen as either part of the system/dont want to antagonise police by demanding thier rights, rather than doing justice for just thier causes when police refuse to do their job. The modsu opearandi of Godi activism is to play ball with Powerful people, once in a while go on TV & tell everyone how bad the system is once ina while. For e.g, I tried filing an FIR for the theft of mobile of my family member in Bangalore Bus , police constable initially refused to allow me to file FIR as a theft, but asked me to file it as lost (both are not same as the later assumes that it's the person's fault for losing mobile, not someone else actively stealing from the person. As per law, if you lost your stuff, police are under no obligation to investigate, unlike the case of theft), then after I argued with him about why I cant report a theft, he relented saying I need to speak to inspector for him to file FIR. I had to go home & come back to the station to meet inspector as he was not in the station tho its office hours & the inspector not only refused to take complaint with no reason. He went apeshit when I asked him to give me in writing that he will not take the complaint. Then I had to go & meet DCP in another station to get the FIR registered in the past, who works from a different police station. I had to run to this other station for multiple days before I ould meet the DCP as he was not even showing up to the station, even after asking people to wait from morning till evening. Its like an emperor deciding when he is goign to showup in the station. Then, he allowed the FIR to be filed, after running behind multiple police stations on multiple days, waiting for hours in every station. Once he approved the FIR, I had to go back to the station in which Inspector sits, and file FIR. They dont FIR immediately as I had to meet this inspector for some reason. So, I had to go home & come back. Then he lectured me as to how I was wrong in demanding of filing an FIR tho he accepted the FIR as his boss was OK with it. The situation is this bad in every Indian police station for the bare minimum of filing a complaint, let alone the kind of nasty piece of work Indian police are when it comes to sabatoging investigations. Finally, they closed my FIR saying they could not find mobile & I dont think they even tried as mobile tracking is somewhat easy as all thats required is registering IMEI number with mobile operators & notify police if anyone puts a SIM with the same or different mobile. That's how bad the system is. Its that badâ€”not by accidentâ€”but by design as Indian police is as unaccountable system as one can get.

Faye D'Souza, just like many in NDTV & rest of estrablishment journalists is not a Godi jouranlist but comes from the line of estrablsihment journalists who are willing to believe the self-deception ofâ€”India is a country of peaceâ€”and rest of clap trap garbage. Anyone who look at the history of India honestly will never come to that conclusion, but the fiction of peace is like an opium for many statusquo-ists as it relieves them of the burden of questioning a rotten system like what we have in India. FYI, I used to have the same naive notions about the reality of India based on this fiction of Peace that's sold to every Indian & this fiction of "peace" has many buyers in the middle class & even some poor. How can peace ever exist in a country where justice is an abberation, not the norm & powerful are rarely punished for thier crimes.

The two major parties of India, Congress & BJP who had indulged in far worse crimes are now demanding the ban of the political outfit SDPI because the [in]actions of law enforcement led to mob committing arson & stone pelting. Using this stone pelting as an excuse led to the subsequent killings by police led to large scale arson, but the deaths were only caused because police shot people dead. Sure, property must be recovered in cases where there is arson. How about appropriating the blame squarely where it belongs? Of those officers who were responsible for not doing their duty deliberately tho they knew it's their job to register FIR for any crime & many hundreds were outside the station demanding the filing of FIR. Why did the police shoot people instead of using tear gas or something of that sort? What role did police play in escalating arson by shooting people dead?

Post this blatant misuse of power, police have arrested random people in the neighbourhood. I have heard from people that random people being picked up after police knock on the door & arrest anyone who is young in the house in the neighbourhood where the arson took place. And now [people are being murdered in polic custody](https://web.archive.org/web/20200816062510/https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/dj-halli-riots-arrested-man-dies-after-surgery/article32364962.ece) under the cover of impunity. It's a wellknown knowledge that Indian police is the most organised criminal gang in India. as these useful idiots aka Rudderless activists & opposition give credibility to police actions instead of fairly assessing the involvement of State's actions in non-State actors indulging in large scale arson.

Also, its funny how Swaraj India representative claims that his party mobilised crores of Indians for protests against CAA/NRC/NPR, as if CAA/NRC/NPR movement had anything to do with political parties. Sure, Swaraj India along with lot more civilian & political organisations did enable platforms for people to come & protest, but it's a far cry from saying we organised crores of people to come onto streets. People poured onto the street on their own, not due to any politial party. BTW, I organised the 1st protest in Bangalore against CAA with the help of few laws & activists in Bangalore even before the act CAA (Citizenship Ammendment Act) was called CAB (Citizenship Amendment Bill).

**Disclaimer:** It need not be said, but I say it anyways so that people don't misconstrue. Most of us already know indulging in violence is justified only as a self-defence measure, to protect one self from an imminent harm to one's safety. An opinion (however unpalatable) is not one where the consequences are that serious & imminent that justify indulgence in violence. As a rule, violence is the worst tool in the toolbox. And those responsible (both State & non-State actors) for recent Bangalore violence should be held to account thru a credible investigation. But, given what we know about Indian police & also about the way power operates in India, there is no good reason to assume that the investigation will be credible at all.

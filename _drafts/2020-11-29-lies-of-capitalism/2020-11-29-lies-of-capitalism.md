> If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it. The lie can be maintained only for such time as the State can shield the people from the political, economic and/or military consequences of the lie. It thus becomes vitally important for the State to use all of its powers to repress dissent, for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie, and thus by extension, the truth is the greatest enemy of the State.

In the world we live in, almost all countries across the world have adopted Capitalism -- _private ownership of the means of production & its use for profit_, as the guiding economic principle.
Despite many of its failings, we are told that the faults of Capitalism lie not at its core, but the disasters of Capitalism exists because either it is misapplied (or) people have not implemented pure form of Capitalism yet anywhere in the world.

In this article I will take a look at the most common claims of the apologists of Capitalism which you find in politics, media, thinktanks, e.t.c.
This article is the product of my own interal struggle where I started from being a believer of Capitalism to my current state where I believe Capitalism as an economic philosophy is completely illegitimate.

This article is written as a conversation between my former self & my current self. A person who was sympathetic to Capitalism vs The skeptic who has seen thru the deception of Capitalism.

## The Conversation

Why Capitalism

**Capitalist:**

Capitalism produces _employment_ & _jobs_.
If we dont have Capitalism, we will not have as many _jobs_, we will be in stone age.

**Skeptic:**

> Capitalism produces _employment_ & _jobs_.

Wrong.
Capitalism _does not_ produce jobs.
Jobs are the _by-product_ of the _need in the marketplace_.
_Need in the marketplace_ is endless.
 For e.g, if we have a vehicle that runs at 100 km/hr today, we would want to have a more safer, affordable, faster, eco-friendly, e.t.c f someone is willing to produce it.
_Marketplace_ exists as soon as we have more than one person who are willing to cooperate & exchange products/services, i.e _Marketplace_ the by-product of the _society_.
No one with Capital will give anyone else job because he has Capital without the _marketplace_.

In otherwords, _needs in the marketplace_ is the primary driver of _jobs_.
Reason why many lost jobs during COVID-19 is because the overall _need in the marketplace_ for products & services went down as we are required to socially distance to keep us safe, not because Capitalists (or) Entreprenaurs all of sudden went to Mars.
If there is no need in the marketplace, it does not matter what someone produces, it has no exhchange value.

Hypothetically, if we send all owners of large _Capitalists_ to Mars today, do you think people wont do the jobs, all the needs in the market will suddenly (or over a course of time) go away & people stop innovating?
The answer is an obvious _No_.
Its because _Capital_ is just a token to exchange future products & services from the _marketplace_ in which such _Capital_ has exchange value.

Capital is just a legal fiction of the society.
_Capitalists_ needs the _Marketplace_.
_Marketplace_ does not need _Capitalists_.
The marketplace is under no obligation to chose just _Capitalism_ as its economic philosphy.
Every system needs to prove it's beneficial to the _owners of the marketplace_ to justify its existence.
The owners of the marketplace are the participants, aka people that participate in such a society.

> If we dont have Capitalism, we will not have as many _jobs_, we will be living in stone age.

Not true.
Since the underlying principle being -- if I act in my self interest, the market will ensure everyone also gets benefited -- such a system will self destruct as there is no such thing as an infinite growth & also whats good for society might not be good for me.
So, there is nothing stopping me from taking every measure (including corruption, overtly or covertly) to stop anyone/anything from hurting my profits.
This is not just a theoritical exercise, but the manifestation in every aspect we see around us.
Also, not all jobs are useful to the wellbeing of the community.
For e.g, Helathcare insurance is a parasitic industry as it increases the overall cost in the economy just to deny people helath with a myriad of excuses & outright bullshit most of the times, while making billions to those who rigged the game in thier favor.
Vast majority of legal gambling called _high frequency trading_ on stock market is extemely harmful to the society as its focus is not resource allocation for delivering actual product/service, rather its job is price arbitration, i.e find tiny difference in prices & making a trade thru the monopolisation/oligopolisation of communication network speed, knowlegde, e.t.c.
There is a need in the society for mass transit in every city which is bioth cost effective & environmetally friendly, but automobile & fuel companies have every interest in ensuring soceity stops investing in public good as that will eat into thier profits.
So, parasitic jobs are harmful to soceity, rather than being useful.

**C:**

But, Capitalism is the engine of _wealth_.
If we stop giving people incentives, why would anyone want to work?
Would you work for free?

**S:**

> But, Capitalism is the engine of _wealth_.

Wealth is a byproduct of serving the needs in the marketplace.
Every system produces wealth, including monarchy, feudalism, aristocracy, plutocracy, oligrachy, socialism, e.t.c.
But the important question to ask is not weather wealth is being produced or not.
But is _wealth production_ is a value in itself?
If we take _feudalism_, it also produced welath.
Important question is _for whom & at what cost to rest of the participants in the marketplace?_.
While feudal lords were extemely rich & vast most lived on the brink of desperation & poverty.

If wealth is a measure of how many products & services are produced, Capitalism is not the one which can produce most.
Capitalism is only interested in multiplication of capital, has no connection with production (or) need fulfillment.
If the multiplication of Capital can happen when most are poor, it promotes that system.
For e.g, even if excess capacity in the factory exist, it does not use full capacity in the factory to produce the product & sell more units at a lower price, capital does not produce such a product even if lack of that product harms more people.
Providing social housing for everyone, Providing helathcare for everyone creates far more products & services and improves the lives of most people, but Capitalists are against it because it reduces thier private profits which they can extract more of -- if those services are not made available at affordable prices, i.e they need the artificial scarcity of helathcare & housing to maximise thier _individual greed_ at the expense of _collective good_ even if that means people actually die/gets hurt.
Also, take _Planned obselence_ -- practice of designing the product to not last long inorder to sell more products/services, that's good for private profits, but bad for the consumer & the society (pollution, wasted resources, e.t.c ).
So, production by its very nature is not value in itself.

If we measure wealth as a measure of how much one has against everyone else (which is what matters), from that standpoint, its true that Capitalism produces most wealth as it creates the most unequal society as putting _private benefit_ aka _greed_ on pedestal always finds all sorts of ways to corrupt society.
_Capitalism_ by its very nature accentuates tiny differences between people to dangerous levels with the scams like _intellectual property_ and so on.

But if we measure from the collective wealth of a soceity, Capitalism does not produce most wealth either.

Imagine the following scenarios.

Suppose we have the following two societies both of which have a 1 billion

1. Everyone take home somwhere between $100K-$500K/year each depending on thier overall contribution to society, we are looking at an avg collective welath of ($250,000 * 1B ) = $250 trillion.
2. 10 people each take home $1 trillion/year, while rest take $10K/year each, we are looking at an overall wealth is (10 * 1T + 10,000 * 1B) = (10 * 1T + 10 * 1T) = 20 trillion.

The 1st society channels the resources to be allocated for common good with a degree of scope for ensure private ingenuinety is incentivised but not a point of absurdity where reward has no relation with work.
In such a society, whoever want to improve the system are incentivised to solve problems of most as most have resources to pay for such innovation.

The 2nd society is far close to reality because thats what Capitalism produces eventually as _capital_ is power & the more you have it, the more you can rig rules to make more _capital_ — Power begets Power.
Also it distorts resource allocation, i.e instead of catering to the needs of the many (such as buidling housing/public hospitals for everyone), it disporportionately shifts the rewards of _social progress_ to cater to the needs of the few who rigged the rules (such as building mansions) to make more for themselves while undermining everyone else who are not fortunate/cunning enough to rig the rules.
This system creates most live miserable lives, while the few at the top -- take, not earn -- the real welath produced in the society.

For e.g, if everyone got billion dollars, its same as everyone having $100 in thier pocket, as everyone got equal purchasing power.
In general, when someone says _wealth_, they are talking about it in relative terms, i.e how much more they have when compared to you.
Feudalism, Aristocracy & Capitalism are kind of similar.
Capitalism = Economic Feudalism.
Its actually more cruel than fuedalism in a way, as feudalism does not make a claim that if feudal lord had his full meal, it will fill the stomachs of everyone else aswell.
But the proponents of Capitalism make very similar claims such as -- Trickle down economics aka a rising tide lifts all boats.
Such claims dont even pass smell test & make the society sick, but the mainstream indoctrination of society by mainstream media & its pandits is exactly that -- thruout 20th century.

Products & Sevices are the by-product of the _needs in the marketplace_, not Capitalism, or any other -ism.

> If we stop giving people incentives, why would anyone want to work?
> Would you work for free?

I dont think anyone is arguing for an utopia where no one works & all needs of marketplace are somehow magically fulfilled.
I wouldnt work for free & I dont think anyone advocates to work for free.
What we are talking about is how best the needs in the marketplace are flufilled while ensuring that those who do the actual work have fair incentives for the fruits of thier labour.

**C:**

Doesnt that mean we need to maximise the incentives to problem solvers in the soceity?
Isnt that what Capitalism enables?
Isnt putting artificial constraints in the way of innovation & problem solvers is counter-productive?
Capitalism is the engine of _innovation_ & human _ingenuity_.

**S:**

> Doesnt that mean we need to maximise the incentives to problem solvers in the soceity?
> Isnt that what Capitalism enables?

Yes, we do need incetives to accelerate the pace of innovation.
But the essence of the problem boils down to the same problem we addressed earlier.
In a Capitalistic system with just private contract between two parties as the foundation, the party with less leverage gets worse deal.
If people can't collectively bargain, they get worse deal each individually than if they bargained collectively.

As we discussed, Capitalism is the philosophy of using Capital to make more of Capital.
If my use of Capital undermines actual problem solving, my capital does that even if it comes at the expense others.
If my use of Capital solves the problem, it solves the problem.
So, long as the private interests of the capital are served, by definition, Capitalism maximises that.
But as soon as we place no control on it, those who get more of it will rig rules in thier favor than those who havent got it.

Take tobbaco for example.
Tobbaco industry sponsored fake studies, ran paid media progapanda, paid politicians to not pass any laws, attacked opponents as any regulation on tobacco will hurt its private bottom line. Funded studies to sow doubt into the consensus that smoking cuases cancer.

Same goes for fossil fuel industries, any corporation for that matter.
The long history of corporations across the world is just that.

So, the only ones whose interests wont be represented are those who have very little Capital.
And by definition, there is no reason for those who acquired capital by either hook or crook not to rig the rules in thier favor to maximise thier profit not so long asthey can getway with it.

> Isnt putting artificial constraints on innovators counter productive?

Lets not confuse innovation with capitalism.
Also, innovation is not always positive.
Positive innovation is all about doing things better than we did before.
For e.g, instead of requiring hard labour to fetch water from a well, now we have pumps.
On the flipside we have negative innovations such as _high frequency trading_, which is nothing but gambling which is nothing but steal resources from actual investments & increasing the costs for everyone in the society.
It is estimated that more than 90% of trades in the market are high frequency trades, meaning, modern stock market is more or less a casino, not a _price discovery mechanism_.

Even in positive innovation case, capitalim has nothing to do with even that.
Capitalism has everything to do with reproduction of capital -- more of it. 
All it takes to ensure "positive" innovation happens is -- ensure no one in the system can compromise compitetion.
Capitalism by definition wants to destory compitetion & the real world evidence indicates that its mostly successful, tho it pays lip service to compitetion.
When private profit is maximimum thru monopoly/oligopoly/cartel, why would Capital wont maximise its return on investment?

Take _intellectual property_ for example.
Its nothing but a tool of creating monopoly profits.
The society paid for all existing knowledge -- schools, libraries, universities, literature, science, laboratories, e.t.c.
But for obvious self serving reasons, we are told unless people are allowed to extract monopoly profits (no compitetion) for decades, people will not innovate.
This is such a bogus claim that no sane person would accept that argument except those who beenfit from such a setup.
People would do something quicker if they have an incentive to benefit from the fruits of thier labour, not when everyone is forced to leave it alone for decades, i.e forcing everyone else to stop solving the problem thru a different method & forcing society to accept this limited improvement, just so the person who solved the problem 1st needs to be allowed to extract monopoly profits.
By creating this monopoly, all further innovation is artificially constrained, i.e Capitalism actually obstructs problem solving rather than solving in a collaborative manner.
But since we live a society controlled by Capital, this bogus argument is allowed to accepted as gospel.

Look at it this way.
Would any society tolerate a person who makes a fraction of an improvement on top of banks of existing knowledge & infstructure who says

* Unless you allow me to ripoff the whole society for next decade (in some cases lifetime of the person + decades), I will not do any improvement?
* Unless you allow me to prosecute anyone who want to improve it further?

The whole life itself is nothing but immitation (copying) & improving whats already there.
Capitalism has far more reasons to stop progress to improve its profits, not improve it.
This is especially true because Capitalism by its very nature creates concentrated wealth, which will be deployed to kill many innovations.

The reason why electric vehicles are delayed so long is because oil & motor industry lobbied to ensure that very little investment goes into that area till it global warming became a threat to whole planet.

So, Capitalism does what it does best.
It exacerbates the tiny differences between humans to absurd degree to ensure that those who won in the last round of wealth control most important economic decisions of society.

> Capitalism is the engine of _innovation_ & human _ingenuity_.

Engine of innovation is the marriage between _needs in the marketplace_, _curiosity of people_ & _competetion_.
_Human ingenuity_ lies outside of Capitalism.
As reiterated above, _Capitalism_ is just about Capital.
Has nothing to do with doing good (or) solving actual problems.

**C:**

But, isnt Capitalism that created _industrial revolution_?.
Dint it move a large percentage of _the world population out of poverty_ in the 21st century?

**S:**

No, it dint.
Individual greed is & was always part of human nature, just like generosity.
Subjugation of everyone by few with the threat of violence (or) thru lies such as divine right (or) meritocracy — is the ultimate greed, which always existed in human societies since the time of agricultural revolution.
Starting from monarchy, military junta, plutocracy, aristocracy, dictatorship & so on.

Yes, many people's standard of living did go up, but the reason why that happened is not because of Capitalism, but because of a combination various factors.
At the core of which is a compitetion, people's disillusion with existing orthodoxy & the invention of printing press and its use across the world without the artifical barriers like _copyright_ (or) _intellectual property_.

Printing press
proxy equations-that-chaned-the world.jpg

This is the rough sketch of what contributed to industrial revolution

1. Invention of printing press, which enabled people to collaborate & make knowledge available to more people than before, allowed people to share knowledge in a more cheaper form -- _Paper_. Which enabled collaboration like never before in human history. This has resulted in knowledge revolution.
2. With these ideas are passed around & once people started reading more and more, traditional hierarchical models (top-down) of monarchy, feudalism; which were backed by religious doctrines of -- divine right of kings are challenged. Once people can started reading religious text & started exploring new ideas, the traditional power of sword & cross were challenged. Knowledge revolution thrown traditional hierarchies that restricted knowledge to tiny few hands was thrown into dustbin of history thru revolutions (except in tiny pockets where this is yet to be eradicated). But that dint stop top-down hierarchy to perperuate itself. The money bags replaced -- divine right of kings -- with -- divine right of capital -- a more sophesticated & colder hearted version of a top-down model -- Capitalism.
3. The knowledge revolution resulted in steam engine which improved productivity, freeing many from drudgery & allowed us to focus on other areas of exploration.
4. Innovation in Credit, specifically — Fractional reserve banking — Ability to borrow on future earnings. i.e Credit gave the buffer for people to try, fail often, but succeed few times to recoup the costs of all other failures, i.e it enabled people to try out various ideas which resulted in most of the innovation we see around.

What spurred & produced innovation is not _individual greed_, rather _collective collaboration_ of people on an unprecedented scale in human history which knowledge revolution enabled.
Life of those who lived in Capitalist societies & non-capitalist societies also improved.
What restrained innovation in the past was greed of the few at the expense of the many — which created walled gardens of knowledge & the agents of these gatekeepers of that knowledge who systematically lied & convinced rest of the society that the best that can be done is -- status-quo.
Once people did realise the artificial social barriers are indeed artificial & they stopped believing in the most self-serving lie of power — without existing coerced hierarchy, the system would be worse than it is.
Once we conquered that major lie, we as humans started to question and understand existing social, political & economic arrangements; started subjecting them to reality to a better degree than before.

For example, take slavery.
There was someone who is willing to capture a human, sell him as a slave & another who is willing to buy that person as slave.
Its pure Capitalism, a _private contract_ between the capitalist & the customer to deliver a slave.
The notion that a _private contract_ between two parties that are interested in thier _private benefit_ is also somehow beneficial for everyone else in the society is the underlying philosophy behind Capitalism.

What about child labour?
Hiring children for the same job at lower pay than an adult actually saved money for capitalists.
Ofcourse, that destroyed the future of the child, but its a valid contract between two parties who agreed to take part in the transaction.

Are they really good tho?

**C:**

You are straw manning _Capitalism_.
No one is asking for unrestrined _Capitalism_.
You need to combine _Capitalism_ with _Liberalism_.
This way, no one will be forced to enter into a contract that they don't want to enter into.
So, the situation of slavery does not even arise.
Since we know children can't consent, as they are not fully aware of the consequences of thier actions, the situation of Child labour does not arise.
We need to maximise _individual liberty_ when it comes to _private contract_ between two parties.
With _individual liberty_ as the foundation, everyone would be allowed to maximise thier profit, compete with each other & produce the best product in most cost effective manner in the _free market_.
And the prices in such a market will be determined thru _supply & demand_.
Once that system exists, _invisible hand_ of the _free market_ will do its magic like it did all these centuries.
We don't need the _nanny state_ to throttle _innovation_ & disturb the balance in the _free market_ by creating burdensome _regulations_.
If anyone in the society does not like a _private contract_ he does not want to engage in, he is free not to engage in that contract.
Capitalism marries _individual good_ with _societal good_ & still preserves individual _freedom_.
Its a _win-win_ for the overall society.

S:

So, now we are talking about _restrained capitalism_, with the rider being _capitalism_ combined with _liberalism_.

Even then, we already estrablished earlier that

1. _Needs in the marketplace_ is the driver of _innovation_, which is the source of all wealth, not capital (or) any single individual capitalist/entreprenaur/corporation.
2. Self interest (_greed_) is inherent to all of us as its the reason why we as human beings were not extinct yet.

Unless _the owners of the marketplace_ aka _society_ cant get a better deal overall any other way, its dangerous tho is putting _private greed_ aka the underlying principle of Capitalism (which you referred to as _individual good_) on the pedestal.

If the individual actors in _the marketplace_ are free to enter into a _private contract_ voluntarily (say an employer-employee relationship), it follows the owners of the marketplace (citizens in the society) are also free to exploit thier asset _the marketplace_ collectively & define what the _maketplace contract_ under which anyone who wishes to exploit _the marketplace_ must adhere to, i.e they get to make the rules governing thier marketplace.
Any actor who wishes to exploit the marketplace (say _employer_) is also _free_ to enter/not to enter _marketplace_ if he feels the _marketplace contract_ is not worth it based on his own _free choice_.
It is this aspect of _marketplace contract_ which is deliberately mis-represented as an infringement on the so called _individual liberty_ by the capitalistic class with an intent to undermine the right of most citizens to effectively use thier _individual liberty_ to organise & define the rules governing thier marketplace to get a better deal collectively thru the _marketplace contract_ rather than losing individually.
In other words, they weaponise _individual contract_ to undermine the right of the owner of _the marketplace_ — Society — to write the rules governing thier property.

In the best case scenario, the owners of the marketplace — Citizens who are the owners of the marketplace — gets to write the rules of the _marketplace contract_.
Since we dont live in a best case scenario in every country across the world, we have to live with the handicapped systems of representative democracies where the collective will is represented by _Government_, tho we know very well they are fully captured by Capitalistic class.

_Private contract_ between 2 parties is a bad way to identify the true cost of products & services in the marketplace.
The price of anything, be it a product/service/wage is a matter of _relative bargaining power_.
The simpleton view of attributing price of product/service to simple supply & demand mismatch is extemely deceptive & is deliberately created by the agents of Capitalism to fool people who are not well versed in the area.

The following diagram shows various actors across whom the final price of a product is negotiated.

Some major negotiation axes are

1. Capitalist-Customers
2. Capitalist-Workers
3. Capitalist-Suppliers
4. Capitalist-Resources
5. Capitalist-Externalities
6. Capitalist-Competition
7. Capitalist-Regulatory Capture

![Corporation interactions](svg-optimized//home/thekalinga/dev/thekalinga.in/_drafts/2020-11-29-lies-of-capitalism/svg/lies-of-capitalism-corporation-interactions.svg){:.featured-image.img-fluid.margin-auto}

Lets understand each of the major axes that are used in the determination of the price (cost to produce + profit) of a product

1. Capitalist-Customer

Since private profit is the motive, there is no reason why a Capitalist needs to stop acquiring more _bargaining power_ in the market thru monopolisation (or) oligopolisation of market, so that he can charge what he pleases for the service without any competetion.

Examples of this include

* [Monopoly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly) (Only one seller) — Electricity, Water, Roads, Railways, Airports, Broadband, Mining, Manufacturing, Pharmaceticals, Medical Equipment & Advanced technologies e.t.c. Most of these acquired by allowing individuals to acquire natural monopolies (or) create artuficial monopolies such as Intellectual property, Govt permits capture, e.t.c
* [Oligopoly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligopoly) (Only few sellers with heavy entry & exit barriers such as heavy investment) — Instead of competing, there is an easy way for competitors to know each other stragies, there by avoiding competing & raising prices in tandem with each tho nothing much has changed on the costs front. Some other strategies include common ownership of stock in competing firms such as they dont compete on price. Industries include Broadband, Telecom, Insurance, Airlines, TV, Oil, Gas, e.t.c
* Cartel — Dividing up markets overt understanding to avoid competetion altogether and make sure customer is left with higher costs & worst service. This is most common in Broadband, Telecom, Insurance, e.t.c

Plus, take a look at COVID vaccines. Tho a large portion of cost was paid from public purse (reasearch grants, guarantreed purchase if successful after COVID outbreak), most of the companies are given near monopoly power in setting the price. The R&D cost is bourne by the society while profits are privitised thru the monopoly instrument called _intellectual property_.

In most of these cases, the price is not determined based on compitetion, rather price is set by those with undue power & custromer can be forced pay anything the capitalist wants.

2. Capitalist-Supplier

Just like with Customer, there is no good reason to not pass the costs onto suppliers by getting disproportionate market power & use that market power into _bargaining power_.
The way this works is exactly the same way it worked in.
Its to become large enough to be able to convert the market into [monopsony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopsony) (or) [ologopsony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligopsony).

Once the market is dominated by one/few large players thru consolidation, the market no longer operates with compitetion.
Suppliers to the corporation can be forced out of the market by corporations simply by refusing to buy from them unless they absorb most costs, far below price at which they sell to the market, eventually leading to bankrupsy of suppliers, reducing the suppliers in the market, which will eventually lead to consolidation amongst the suppliers aswell, leading to monopoly/oligopoly in the supply market too.
This usually leads to suppliers underbidding each other to a point in a race to the bottom in the hopes of holding onto business even if that means selling something below compitetive price to drive out the opponents.

More often than not, the monopsony corporation itself buys the supplier to consolidate supply chain end to end, often by forcing the supplier into losses & then bidding for the business of the supplier far below market price with a threat that the supplier's contract with monoposony would be terminated unless he sells below fair price for the company.

Once consolidation happens in the supplier market, any price can be forced onto customers by corporations as there is no competetion.
The only way to survive in the market is thru consolidation by killing competetion, using the size of the marketshare in determining price rather than compitetive price.

Examples of this include food supply chain capture by corpotaions to force farmers to sell below cost of production because the sales channel between farmers & customers is olgiopolised by supply chain companies that buy off politicians to remove all protections farmers have.

Same is true for suppliers to supermarkets, who are forced to sell far below marketprice to large supermarkets because they destroyed compitetion thru oligiopolisation.

3. Capitalist-Workers

Story is very similar here.
Capture large enough market power & use that market power as _bargaining power_ when negotiating salaries & benefits for workers.
This way the cost of product/service can be passed onto workers.

If workers dont have any safety net—such as—minimum wage, no safe working conditions, no overtime pay, limited number of working hours, child labour, workman's comp, e.t.c, the final price of the product/service coporation sells can be forced to be absorbed by workers in the form of lower wages & benefits.

By definition, those with concentrated power will have far more power to dictate terms than those who dont, which is why corporations dont like labour unions.

Just like in the case _Corporation-Supplier_ interaction, if Govt can be bribed to not provide any employment at living wage, corporations can pay however low they want with till the point of starvation wages.
If the whole market can be captured like in the case of online marketplaces, we are back to monopsony & oligospony cases--where workers can be forced to rent themselves (work) at far lower wages than if workers had opportunity to move across competing companies.

Labour unions give fair shot to workers as collectively they can get a better bargain when it comes to negotiation than individually as individually each of them are weak.
Its so much easy for someone with muscle to fight thousands of people one at a time, than for him to take on thousand collectively.
Incase of corporation, its uses its muscle (money) to get a better deal for itself if it can find ways to stop workers from forming unions & bargain a better deal collectively.
Which is why corporations across the world hire people to bust unions with the help of captured political parties, brew strifes within union, e.t.c.

4. Capitalist-Externalities

Externality is a positive/negative cost imposed on a party which is not a party to a transaction.
Since we only care about negative externality, when we look purely from the _private contract_ point of view, the cost borne by the external parties is never accounted for in the contract.

Examples include

* Environmental destruction -- When a factory pollutes environment, the cost of cleanup, health issues, damage to the envionment, e.t.c. All of these costs are borne by society. Many times these costs are borne disproportiately by the poor. Due to global warming, a significant portion of the world is affected negatively, including flooding in lowlying areas, exteme weather events, e.t.c.
* No minimum wage -- When workers are systematically underpaid below living wage, people will be forced to rely on govt subsidies which means the costs are passed onto the workers and unto society indirectly.

5. Capitalist-Competition

When companies engage in anti-competetive behaviour either thru collusion/consolidation (which is quite) thru monopoly/oligopoly/monopsony/oligopsony/e.t.c, the price is no longer dependent on the competeion.
So, corporation can to charge anything it wants to customer.

Underlying reason is the customer has no _bargaining power_ to negotiate the price.

6. Capitalist-Regulatory Capture

Amongst the most dangerous power capitalists can capture is this.
All aspects of above can only be enforced if they capture this power.
There are various ways of capturing this power, but at the core of it is ensuring either the rules that govern corporations are written in thier favor (or) at the least ensure those that enforce the rules dont do it.

It is in the nature of _private interest_ to ensure that this be the case.
Which is why almost all over the world, corporations are at the center of both covert and overt lobbying to ensure that the rules governing the marketplace are not enforced. Labour unions are either outright banned (or) sabotaged.

Once the regulator is captured, the costs are all passed onto the marketplace.

In essence, the cost of a product/service is manipulated thru various means.
The only factor common to all these stregigies is -- _relative bargaging power_.

Arent you killing innovation by imposing restrictions on Capitalism?
Wouldnt innovators not want to do stuff unless you allow them exploit thier work fully?

of its easy to pick on each 


if the input costs can be passed onto someone else

Let me give few examples to demostrate

For e.g, if instead of providing a safe working condition for workers to work (implies increased cost to produce product), if the workers can be forced to work in dangerious conditions, the final cost of the product will be reduced, but the actual cost is passed onto the workers while the capitalist is still taking his profits home.

A product/service does not impact just the 2 two people participating in the 

Since private _self interest_ is the guiding principle in Capitalism, it follows that, the strong & wicked will have more bargaining power when compared to the weak & honest when the system is corrupt.
The more decision making process is removed from the real owner of the _marketplace_ (citizens), the better it is for the powerful to rig rules in thier favor, i.e make them more powerful.
The more strong one becomes, the more power he acquires, exacerating imbalance by design tho the strong does not deliver any better sevice.
They are just utilising thier strong position to make more for themselves at the expense of everyone else, but delivering worst service at the highest profit.
That is the main reason why the living standards of workers in Scandanavia are far better when compared thier counterparts in India & Pakistan, not because there is lack of workforce in Scandanavia (or) workers in Scandanavian hotels do far more work/far more productive.
From the point of view of the market, the guy with  a contract involving a product being transacted in the marketplace, the only actors that are affected parties are not just the producer & consumer.
The end price customer pays affect 
It includes workers that participate in the transaction & the rest of the society over which there are implications of these private contracts.
Take environmental protection.

For e.g, Take American invasion of Iraq.
The corporations in collusion with Govt of US (which is has very little to do with the interests of citizens of US) went & massacred a whole country based on a lie that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction (which even if it had, which it did not — American elite had no business in invading).
These corporations got paid for destruction & mass slaughter — Jets, Bombs, Ammunition, Vehicles, Hired mercenaries, Logistics of all sorts such as Food, Shelter, torture centers, e.t.c.
Then some of these corporations got paid for reconstruction aswell — building infrastructure which they just destoyed.
Then they produced more people enraged on the revenge, which results in escalation of violence, which is an excuse for further mass slaughter.
i.e These corporations were paid for both demolishion & reconstutction (ofcourse without the consent of people of Iraq).
As you can see, they can do this forever, as its a self-fulfilling cycle.




**C:**

Have you seen the way Government functions?
How unaccountable they are?
Were you ever happy about the services they provide?
Look at Govt services, they deliver inefficient & unaccountable services when compared to the services delivered by _free market_.
Also, take a look at modern Capitalistic society when compared to Soviet union.
Soviet union was such a disaster because communists/socialists thought they can coerce the individual to the mythical wellbeing of society.
What ended up happening is a dictatorship with bread lines, gulag (slave camps) & eventual collapse.
Have you heard of — Tragedy of commons — i.e if a resource is common, no one takes care of it & it will eventually be worse for everyone.
Socialism is _greedy_ as it infringes on people's rights to be _industrious_ by artificially limiting one's ability to produce welath.
It's the ideology of greedy, talentless & lazy people who envy the success of _smart_ & _successful_ people & want to steal that.
Do you want that?

**S:**

The problem is the functions of government are disconnected from accountability.
In existing system, the complete rule making power is concentrated in the few at the top.
And citizens have no mechanism to hold bureuacrats accountable.
The reason why Capitalists are able to rig rules is because the power is so concentrated and when it is concentrated, its easy to rig the selection process.

In case of Government they can be held to account for thier actions to a limited degree, unlike corporations.
So, moving decision making power from public domain (incase of Govt) to secret rooms (Corporations) is a step in the wrong direction.

We need the accountability to devolved into citizens hand thru decentralisation of power.

## Conclusion

If Capital can multiply by doing good, it does that.
If Capital can multiply by doing evil, it does that too, i.e if someone can profit off by lying, stealing & killing — it does that too.
The only value judgement Capital has is only from the point of _individual greed_, i.e what's good for me, always looking for _local optimum_, even if it makes other's lives worse, i.e creates a worse _global optimum_.
Capitalism is like _growth_ in human body.
Just like growth in the body, growth is good for the host, but unlikenormal growth, Capitalism is uncontrolled growth that almost always destroy the host unless it is controlled.
In conclusion, Capitalism is cancer.






Socialism is _greedy_ as it infringes on people's rights to be _industrious_ by artificially limiting one's ability to produce welath.
Without Capitalism, we will not have compitetion.
Capitalism promotes _liberty_.
Capitalism is _efficient_.

Only from the PoV of the organisation, that too from its profit point of view. Not from the point of veiw of society.

Take most automobile companies.
The price of the automobile is competed against, but post purcharse, i.e for servicing & spare parts, its near monopoly pricing.
And most cars more or less produce similar components, with slight variation.
If all of the are doing similar things while ensuring that exploring new ways

And a non-signigficant % of the expenditure is in marketing, inducing the customer to do an impulse purchase, rather than actual cost benefit analysis.
Marketing is not efficient.

Capitalism promotes freedom.
Capitalism promotes _innovation_.
Capitalism brings _investment_.
Capitalism maximises _human potential_. It promotes _freedom_.
Capitalism fulfills _human needs_.
Capitalism produced _modern technology_.
Capitalism promotes _free market_.
If the worker does not like the wages, he is free to leave & work for someone else.
Capitalism is _good for society_.
No one should affect the balance in the _free market_.
Taxation is _theft_.
If we dont allow people to make billions (thru parents, copyrights, ), people will not have enough incentive to innovate.
If you are not with Capitalism, you advocating for Socialism. Communism killed so many people across the world. Capitalism promotes _innovation_.

The job of capitalism is to ensure _Capital_ multiplies, i.e its primary directive is _individual greed_ not _collective good_.
Greed is inherently part of everyday living as we are the by-product of natural selection at the core of which is the need to adopt & survive.
But, we as species are the top of food chain not because of our greed, but we cooperate & collaborate in large groups.
We are able to cooperate & collaborate because unlike other species, we have the ability to store & transfer knowledge from one generation, one person to the next with some shared beliefs, unlike any other animal on the planet.

Unrestrained greed is Cancer.
Capitalism is Cancer.

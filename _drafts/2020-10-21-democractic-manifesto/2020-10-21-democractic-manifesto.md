> We [the Moderns] are like dwarves perched on the shoulders of giants [the Ancients], so that we can see more than they, and things at a greater distance, not by virtue of any sharpness of sight on our part, or any physical distinction, but because we are carried high and raised up by their giant size.

_**NOTE**: This is a priliminary draft version; in need of collaboration & contribution. If you find any obvious mistakes in this article that I have overseen (or) ideas that needs to be added/removed (or) more context is required in any section, please feel free to post a comment/criticism so that we can discuss & build a better version._

As yourself the following question.
Suppose you live one of the many _shell democracies_ that call themselves _democracies_ & you just participated in an election today.
Suppose a demagogue (or) religious zealot (or) fascist (or) cultist (or) an ideologue (or) an unscruulous but ambitious person took over your country.
What gurantees you have to ensure your next election would be as fair as it is today?
In other words, what gurantees you have to ensure that he will not destroy the _shell_ you pretend to be a _democracy_ completely before next election?

In the existing system we have, do you have provisions where serious decisions require long term commitment where as non-serious decisions are means of determining as limiting/enhancing rights to certain category of people/entities, say thru _constitutional ammendment_, what process you have to ensure that such a decision is valid not just today but tomorrow?

This manifesto is the result of my frustration with the lack of a concrete political system[^political-systems-credit] which address most important aspects of governing the society such as :—

1. Ensure _rules_ governing citizens are _actually_ made by _citizens_, independent of the assertions of managers (politicians).
2. Ensure every citizen has zero-cost equal ability w.r.t influencing _gathering_ & _distibution_ of information that affects _rule making process_.
3. Ensure _rule interpretation_ process is neutral, independent of the assertions of intermediaries (bureaucrats — tax collectors, police, judges, e.t.c).
4. Ensure _rights_ of minority are never at the mercy of majority, in _actuality_, not just in _theory_.
5. Ensure no amount of election mandate threatens the foundational _competitive nature_ of Democracy while ensuring (1), (2) & (3) are not unduly influenced.

Here are the assumptions this manifesto makes

1. Each of us are part greedy & part geneorus, part kind & part cruel, part lazy & part hard-working, part creative & part mediocre e.t.c.
2. You know what's in your best interest than anyone else — if you have equal access to the summary of _least biased_[^least-biased] information that's accssible to others.

## TLDR[^tldr]

_Competition_ is the foundation of _Democracy_. _Power_ flows from ability to influence others.


## Background

Despite a majority of the societies across the world proclaiming themselves to be Democracies, ever wondered why

* The wellbeing of vast majority of people in these alleged[^alleged-later] Democracies is maintained only to a point of subsistence, where people — more or less — are cogs in the wheel who are always kept insecure about thier livelihood, all the while most benefits of the fruits the marketplace aka human progress are siphoned off by few?
* None of these alleged Democracies (lets not talk about non-Democracies as they are even worse) as they exist today provide no protection against demagogues, facists, militias, capitalists, politburo & authoritarians structures of all sorts — which are gateways which transform Democracy to an authoriterian states?
* Not a single country on the planet has law & order system that applies same rules to both powerful & powerless, not on paper, but in practice.

Historically there are many political philosophies which claimed they are the best for any given soceity, starting from — Monarchy, Military Junta, Theocracy, Fascism, Aristocracy, Democracy ([Representative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_democracy) & [Direct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_democracy)), e.t.c.

There are 3 types of political structures which are deployed across the world.

1. Top-down: Rules governing citizens are decided by a select group of people at the top. They are Monarchy, Military Junta, Theocracy, Fascism, Aristocracy, Authoritarian Communism, [Representative Democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_democracy). In these systems citizens have very little control over the rules that govern them. Amongst these systems, the only system where citizens have some amount of control over the rules is [Representative Democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_democracy). This is the system that's deployed across most countries around the world. The rules made by the _governing class_ will then be coerced onto _citizens_ because _governing class_ has monopoly over _tools of control_ over our body & mind[^explained-later]. Since the rules are decided by _governing class_, the decisions made are mostly done to further the interests of _governing class_, not citizens.
2. Bottom-up: Rules governing _citizens_ are decided by the _citizens_ themsleves. [_Direct Democracy_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_democracy) is one such system where citizens gets to decide on what rules they want to be governed by.
3. Mixed-mode: Where a portion of decisions are taken by _citizens_ & another portion by _governing class_.

The major advantage of top-down system are

1. Few people involved in making decisions. So, logistically its far more efficient.
2. Since decisions are centralised, important decisions can be delegated to _experts_ who make decisions by applied specialised skills to the existing state of society.

Major disadvatnages of top-down system are

1. Citizens have little (_Representative Democracy_) to no voice (Monarchy, Military Junta, Theocracy, Fascism, Aristocracy, Authoritarian Communism) in making the rules.
2. _Rule making body_ has little to no consequence if rules are not inline with the interests of citizens.
3. Even if the rules on the surface look to be in the interests of citizens, there is no protection for citizens from [_motivated_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivated_reasoning) (or) _arbitary_ (or) _capricious_  (or) _corrupt_ interpretation by those who interpret these rules (bureaucracy, police & judiciary).
4. Rule _interpretter_ have little no consquence if rules are interpretted in a _motivated_ (or) _arbitary_ (or) _capricious_ (or) _corrupt_ manner.
5. Far more oppressive since citizens dint make these rules, have no reason to believe they are written by keeping the interests of citizens in mind & have no trust in either validity of either the rules (or) the interpretation, they have less incentive to stick to the rule & rules will be broken. Only way to keep citizens in line is thru oppression & propganda.

The major advantage when it comes to Bootom-up system are

1. Citizens get to make the rules they want to obey, decisions are made with thier interest in mind, not some overlord's interests.
2. If rule _interpretation_ can be contrained by rules written by citizens, degrees of _interpretation_ can be constrained by citizens thru new rules.
3. Rules governing _motivated_ (or) _arbitary_ (or) _capricious_  (or) _corrupt_ interpretation of (1) are also written by citizens, there is less scope for corruption.
4. Since rules are created with the consent of citizens, there are far more incentives for citizens to follow the rules that all citizens will be governed by.

The major downsides when it comes to _Direct Democracy_ are

1. Since all citizens are not well versed in all areas of society, its near impossible to educate everyone on everything & such decisions are potentially flawed.
2. Not all citizens have the willingness, ability & resources (time, money & knowlege) to participate in the rule making process.
3. Protecting minority rights from being subjected to the whims of majority trample needs to be taken care of[^even-more-severe].

This manifesto starts with perticulates such as the pillars of _power_, major factors determining _power_, why none of the systems in use across the world today is not even remotely fair (Capitalism, Communism), why a mixed-mode _Direct Democracy_ is the most superior political system, what are the ingredients of citizen centric _Democracy_ with an outline of a system built with these foundational principles.

> It is the eternal struggle between these two principles — right and wrong — throughout the world. They are the two principles that have stood face to face from the beginning of time; and will ever continue to struggle. The one is the common right of humanity, and the other the divine right of kings. It is the same principle in whatever shape it develops itself. It is the same spirit that says, _You toil and work and earn bread, and I'll eat it_. No matter in what shape it comes, whether from the mouth of a king who seeks to bestride the people of his own nation and live by the fruit of their labor, or from one race of men as an apology for enslaving another race, it is the same tyrannical principle.

> — Abraham Lincoln

All citizens must have zero-cost equal ability (not oportunity) to all the tools that influence 

_Power_ is the ability to write, interpret & enforce rules.
_Power_ by its nature is far too important & corrupting to be left in the hands of _few_ to write rules for everyone else, just because they won the lottery called — election.
_Power_ in human societies flows directly from the _ability to influence_ others.
Once someone/group has the ability to influence rest — either directly (or) indirectly by influencing influencers — the group that influences the most gets to _dictate & enforce rules_ in its own image, almost always in self-serving fashion, at the expense of rest.
Since the time of early societies, even the extemely limited ability of _citizens_ in influencing (let alone writing) the _rules_ that govern them has come at a huge cost — the cost bourne by generations of our predecessors across the world — in blood & broken bodies.
History of the world from the time of agricultural resolution till now is a struggle of _the many_ against the rules/laws written by _the few_ whose motto is — _You toil, work & earn bread, and I'll eat it_.

There are 2 major types of these _abilities_ to influence others[^others-usage].

* Violence
* Non-violent persuation (will be referred to as _persuation_)

Influencing others thru _violence_ is as old as the Animal kingdom itself.
Since the consequences of violence (or) the threat of violence are quite drastic & can be quite risky for the stability of the regime, its quite an unsustainable form of influence in human societies unless it is coupled with the 2nd type of influence _persuation_.
Since the legitimacy of this kind of influence is the ability unleash violence, _the many_ that are oppressed also can chose to unleash violence against _the few_ without any quams, justifiably so.

If history is any guide, _the oppressed_ will overthrow the _the oppressors_ sooner or later — as soon as _the oppressed_ will reciprocate the same violence _the oppressor_ uses.
_The oppressor_ can be from either majority/minority.
In fascist states, despite being hierarchical in nature, _the majority_ play the role of _the oppressor_, tho they themselves are part of a hierarchy within the fascist pecking order. In vast majority of societies in human history, _the oppressor_ is part of _the minority_.

In order to understand what these tools of pursuation of are, lets take a quick walk thru human history.

We—the modern humans—are descendents of [Homo sapiens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_modern_human) & despite us not being the strongest species physically (or) largest, it is hypothesised that we are able to stay at the top of food chain due to the size of our brain & our ability to co-operate in large groups when compared to any other species on earth[^other-human-traits]. This large scale cooperation requires ability form _shared beliefs_[^inter-subjective-reality].

During [hunter-gatherer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter-gatherer) phase of human development, it is argued that the soceities were mostly egaliterian & the ability influence each other is based on age, ability to speak to gods/ancestors, knowing the terrian, e.t.c. Since hunter-gatherer society is quite small, peer pressure is more or less enough. So, I will not dwell deep into this as these structures don't naturally apply themseleves to complex structures.

Post [agricultural revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultural_revolution), men of violence aka King & his henchmen held influence over thier subjects initially thru the weapon of violence, but on large part by persuding people that the [king had the right to rule because of his special relationship with the divine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_right_of_kings) which was largely perpetuated by the monopolisation of religious doctrines. Since writing & speaking forign languages was niche, kings used to hire men who knew how to write/speak non-native language, a combination of lack of education of most people, coupled with doctrines being written in a language that's usually not written in common tongue, its was somewhat easy to propagandise _the many_ that king is someone who executes the will of god and has a rightful claim to influence aka right to.

TODO: Power to make & enforce rules

## Historical background

TODO: Talk about starting with one person, then more than one person & the power over mind (aka fiction)

## Problems with existing systems

TODO: Monarchy, Despots/Dictators, Theocracy, Capitalism, [Applied] Communism, [Contemporary] Democracy

## Solution

* Rules of Expediency vs Rules of Fundamental
    * Fundamental right changes must be asserted over long period to take effect. A simple withdrawal is good enough to rollback over the period
* Primacy of Citizen
    * Democratisation of ideation process thru competition
        * Foundation
        * 0-cost equal ability, not equality of opportunity
* Rule making body as anchor for every other system
* Rule interpreters (both short term & long term) to be independent of temporal political pressures & flow from above

[^tldr]: **T**oo **L**ong, **D**int **R**ead.

[^even-in-dictatorship]: Even in dicatorships, even if the geography has valuable natural resources & the _governing class_ can easily control population thru violence by hiring mercenaries to protect natural resources & using some of these proceeds to terrorised citizens, citizens are still required to be propgandised as its much more cost effective to control people thru propaganda than it is to control them physically.

[^even-more-severe]: This problem of protecting minority rights is most severe in most top-down systems when compared to bottom up systems as in top-down systems both majority and minority are in the 

[^alleged-later]: Will explain later why I call existing political systems that proclaim themselves as _alleged_ democracies rather than Democracies

[^others-usage]: By others, I mean all living beings in the Animal Kingdom

[^assuming-the-tools-are-not-monopolised]: Assuming tools of violence are not monopolised by the few

[^other-human-traits]: There are other traits like domestication of fire, domestication of plants e.t.c, but most of it flows from what Yuval Noah Harari termed as _Cognitive revolution_ in his excellent book [Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23692271-sapiens)

[^inter-subjective-reality]: In [Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23692271-sapiens), Yuval Noah Harari refers to this as _shared fiction_ (or) _inter subjective reality_. Broadly he divides the reality we percieve into 3 kinds. The 1<sup>st</sup> one being _Objective reality_ i.e Reality that exists outside of the observer aka _subject_, e.g, Gravity. If we drop a ball & if we subjectively chose not to observe the fall of the ball, the ball hits the ground objectively irrespective of any subject observing it. The 2<sup>nd</sup> type of reality called _Subjective reality_ also known as _individual belief_, i.e set of beliefs that are true at the level of the observer/individual/subject, i.e our individual beliefs about the world based on our subjective interpretations of reality. In other words, this reality is true only for the individual in question. So each of us can have individual beliefs that are true for each of them individually, i.e subjectively. For e.g, the best color on earth is Grey. This _subjective reality_ is true for me. This _subjective reality_ might concur (or) conflict with the _subjective reality_ of other people . Lastly, the 3<sup>rd</sup> kind of reality is the most powerful force that helped our species to collaborate in large numbers & stay ahead of every other earth bound species i.e — _Inter-subjective reality_ — also known as _shared beliefs_. These are the beliefs that are shared by a large group of people that help us trust & collaborate in large groups. This large scale cooperation exists in no other species on such a large scale other than in Homo Sapiens. This is the force that defines most of the rules of the society to live in — starting from religion paving way for divine of kings, secular human rights, capitalism, communism and every other belief system — economic, social, political, e.tc.

Three levels

Expedient rules
Foundational aspects (Right to life, Right to be free from coersion, Right to form associations)

The pretence that expedient interpreter of law aka executive is somehow seperated from the legislature is nothing but distinction without a difference. In almost all executives

On faction thinks that the ultimate problem is greed & its born out of the lack of empathy for the fellow man. While the other side thinks the world is dog eat dog & have sympathies to social darwinism of survival of the fittest aka Law of the Jungle. While the former denies the reality of our biological evolution aka we are at the top of the food chain because we are a species that learnt to bend the nature to our will & our fitness is the product of survival which is greed by its very nature.

Competition

Citizen & Opposition

* Citizen is the ultimate decision maker
* Citizen must have access to zero-cost freedom credit to shield himself from undue influence
* Opposition shoulders the burden of Minority rights
* Democracy
* Long term decisions needs be asserted over long period of time than short term decisions

Legislature: Long term legislation
Enforcement
    Judiciary: Medium term interpretation of rules, Power to make transient legislations thru rulings & Determine validity of rules
    Executive: Short term interpretation of rules, Power to make sub-ordinate legislations & Enforcement of rules by Legislature & Judiciary

The _estrablishment_ aka the _ruling class_ prefer _top-down_ system because they get to make rules & almost always the rules are designed to enhance thier power (or) at the least to ensure they don't lose power. The justification of this power is done thru various tools of indoctrination & its achived mainly thru centralisation of resources, information & propaganda [^even-in-dictatorship]. Here is why top-down model is fundamentally a scam.

Would you want to live in a society that's ruled by a Dictator? If your answer is _Obviously No!_, you made the right choice.

What if he promises to be _benevolent_? If your answer is — _May be_, the answer is still _wrong_ & here is why.

The problem with the _benevolence_ rider is this — once you allow someone to rule over you based on mere promise & you have no way to break the contract with the dictator as soon as his definition of _benevelonce_ varies from your definition of _benevelonce_, you are living in a _tyranny_.
Since you opted for dictatorship, you waived-off your right to be judged by a _neutral 3rd party_ on whether a given action of the Dictator is _benevolent_ or not.
The struggles of our predecessors across the world in various countries have showns that this _divergence of definition_ is _inevitable_ — sooner than later — and then you are left with a binding aggrement you can't get out if the ruling class games succession plan using the tools accessible to them.
The only way to break the contract is violence, which more often than not most people dont want to engage in & those who utilise such a tool will be willing let go of it so easily as they have control over everyone else now.

Its not a business what all you have are profits

never always better to retain control over the rules Its not surprising that people know what's in our best interests, If we make an assumption() Even though _direct democracy_ is the best system out there as — one knows what's best for him if he has sufficient knowledge. Unlike every other political system where citizens is only permitted to be an audience member in the rule making process instead of active drafter, in direct democracy citizen gets to be the drafter. But this system as they exists today suffers from 2 major problems. 

Also there are multiple economic philosphies such as — Capitalism, Communism, Socialism.

Capitalism & Authoritative communism (Bolshevism in Russia, Communist party in China e.t.c) by its very nature centralises economic power. With concentrated economic power, its extemely easy to manipulate political system to rig rules in one's favor.

There are two schools of thought that are quite prevalent in our society when it comes to how decisions must be made. One that proclaims that unrestrained greed is the best for the whole society. While another that proclaims what's lacking is compassion.

[^least-biased]: As its almost impossible to have unbiased information about most aspect of reality we observe.

[^political-systems-credit]: I did a limited analysis of (picking good parts & avoiding bad parts) various political & economic ideologies such as — Tribalism, Monarchy, Military Junta, Theocracy, Fascism, Aristocracy, Plutocracy, Majoriterianism, Capitalism, Liberalism, Communism, Socialism (specifically [Libertarian Socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_socialism)), [Representative Democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_democracy), [Direct Democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_democracy) & [Participatory Economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_economics). I also took insipration from ideas such as universal public funding of [Health care](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publicly_funded_health_care), [Elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publicly_funded_elections), Media & Education.

Those who makes the rules should not get to interpret the rules
Interpretation of rules must be politically neutral, i.e interpretors must to have independence

Find out just what any people will quietly submit to and you have found out the exact measure of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them, and these will continue till they are resisted with either words or blows, or with both. The limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress.

Q: Who writes the rules that citizens must be governed by?

A: Only citizens, not leaders/managers/bureaucrats

Q: Since citizens will be busy with thier lives & its hard to track all rules governing society (policies), how do we handle it

A: We elect managers to push for thier ideas & citizens will decide which one is useful to them and which one is not

Q: How do we handle the disputes in the shorter term?

A:

Q: How do you ensure that citizens are not unduly influenced by a tiny minority who want to further thier interests?

A:

Q: How do you prevent a powerful minority from taking over?

Q: How do you prevent trampling of fundamental rights of minority by majority even if the majority choses to ?

1. Citizen first in rule making
2. Equitable compitetion (as opposed to equal opportunity) in finding truths that matter
3. Neutral arbiters of short term rule making & rule interpretation

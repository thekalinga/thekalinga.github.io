> We [the Moderns] are like dwarves perched on the shoulders of giants [the Ancients], so that we can see more than they, and things at a greater distance, not by virtue of any sharpness of sight on our part, or any physical distinction, but because we are carried high and raised up by their giant size.

## Introduction

Power in human societies flows directly from the _ability to influence_. Once someone/group has the ability to influence rest, the group that influences the rest gets to _dictate & enforce rules_ in its own image, always in self-serving fashion. Since the time of early societies, this _power to make rules_ is only liberalised by the struggle of _the many_ against the rules/laws that are written to serve _the few_ in power. As [Noam Chomsky]() said, rights were always fought for by people, power never gives up . There are major 2 types of these _abilities_ to influence.

* Violence
* Persuation

Influencing others thru violence is as old as the Animal kingdom itself. But, it is inherently unsustainable form of influence in human societies as sooner (or) later _the few_ who hold on to power using this form of persuation without consent of _the many_ will be overthrown by many—as the violence of _the many_ against violence of _the few_ who wield power—is morally justifiable & not internally inconsitent from the point of view of _the many_. Since _the many_ are far more than _the few_ who wield power, the doctroine of _influence thru violence_ is only a short term strategy for power. So, generally every power structure resorts to various other tools to make the many believe that its use of power is in the interests of _the many_.

In order to understand what these tools of pursuation of are, lets take a look at quick look at human history followed by modern tools deployed across various political prevaling political structures.

We—the modern humans—are descendents of [Homo sapiens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_modern_human) & despite not being the strongest species physically (or) largest, it is hypothesised that we are able to stay at the top of food chain is because of the size of our brain & our ability to co-operate in large groups when compared to any other species on earth[^other-human-traits]. This large scale cooperation requires ability form _shared beliefs_[^inter-subjective-reality].

During [hunter-gatherer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter-gatherer) phase of human development, it is argued that the soceities were mostly egaliterian & the ability influence each other is based on age, ability to speak to gods/ancestors, knowing the terrian, e.t.c. Since hunter-gatherer society is quite small, peer pressure is more or less enough. So, I will not dwell deep into this as these structures don't naturally apply themseleves to complex structures.

Post [agricultural revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultural_revolution), men of violence aka Kings held influence over thier subjects thru the weapon of violence, but mostly on large part by persuding people that the [king had the right to rule because of his relationship with the divine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_right_of_kings) which was largely perpetuated by the monopolisation of religious doctrines. Thru a combination of lack of education of most people, coupled with doctrines being written in a language that's usually not written in common tongue, its was somewhat easy to propagandise _the many_ that king is someone who executes the will of god and has a rightful claim to influence aka right to.

TODO: Power to make & enforce rules

## TLDR

TODO: Final conclusion

## Historical background

TODO: Talk about starting with one person, then more than one person & the power over mind (aka fiction)

## Problems with existing systems

TODO: Monarchy, Despots/Dictators, Theocracy, Capitalism, [Applied] Communism, [Contemporary] Democracy

## Solution

* Rules of Expediency vs Rules of Fundamental
    * Fundamental right changes must be asserted over long period to take effect. A simple withdrawal is good enough to rollback over the period
* Primacy of Citizen
    * Democratisation of ideation process thru competition
        * Foundation
        * 0-cost equal ability, not equality of opportunity
* Rule making body as anchor for every other system
* Rule interpreters (both short term & long term) to be independent of temporal political pressures & flow from above

## Footnotes

[^other-human-traits]: There are other traits like domestication of fire, domestication of plants e.t.c, but most of it flows from what Yuval Noah Harari termed as _Cognitive revolution_ in his excellent book [Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23692271-sapiens)

[^inter-subjective-reality]: In [Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23692271-sapiens), Yuval Noah Harari refers to this as _shared fiction_ (or) _inter subjective reality_. Broadly he divides the reality we percieve into 3 kinds. The 1<sup>st</sup> one being _Objective reality_ i.e Reality that exists outside of the observer aka _subject_, e.g, Gravity. If we drop a ball & if we subjectively chose not to observe the fall of the ball, the objective reality the ball falling onto the ground under the gravity is objectively true. Then we have our 2<sup>nd</sup> type of reality called _Subjective reality_ also known as _individual belief_, i.e set of beliefs that are true at the level of the observer/individual/subject, i.e our individual beliefs about the world based on our subjective interpretations of reality. In other words, this reality is true only for the individual in question. So each of us can have individual beliefs that are true for each of them individually subjectively.  which can either concur (or) conflict with each other. Lastly, the 3<sup>rd</sup> kind of reality is the most powerful force that helped our species to collaborate in large numbers & stay ahead of every other earth bound species i.e—_Inter-subjective reality_—also known as _shared beliefs_. These are the beliefs that are shared by a large group of people that help us trust & collaborate in large groups. This large scale cooperation exists in no other species on such a large scale other than Homo Sapiens. This is the force that defines most of the rules of the society to live in—starting from religion paving way for divine of kings, secular human rights, capitalism, communism and every other economic & belief system we humans have come up with so far to govern ourselves.

Three levels

Expedient rules

Foundational aspects (Right to life, Right to be free from coersion, Right to form associations)

The pretence that expedient interpreter of law aka executive is somehow seperated from the legislature is nothing but distinction without a difference. In almost all executives

On faction thinks that the ultimate problem is greed & its born out of the lack of empathy for the fellow man. While the other side thinks the world is dog eat dog & have sympathies to social darwinism of survival of the fittest aka Law of the Jungle. While the former denies the reality of our biological evolution aka we are at the top of the food chain because we are a species that learnt to bend the nature to our will & our fitness is the product of survival which is greed by its very nature.
